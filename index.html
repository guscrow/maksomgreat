<h1>Why is visualization great?</h1>
<p>Cairo says visualization works because "most people grasp the truth of an assessment only when they unequivocally envision the evidence for it." This means that most people have a hard time visualizing data just using our brain. Being able to see the data helps us understand it better because our brains don't have to do the work to visualize it.</p>
<h1>What are the more effective ways to encode data for perceptual tasks?</h1>
<p>First you need to establish the message that you wish to convey. Meaning, choose the data you wish to show. Second, try out different graphic forms to show the data. You may need multiple ways to represent the data. Third, arrange the components of the data in a way that it is easy to understanding the meaning behind it. Last, show the visualization to someone that is representative of the audience you are trying to communicate to.</p>
<h1>What are trade-offs that Cairo asks us to consider when building a visualization?</h1>
<p>When representing your data, use logical and meaningful baselines. This means if you are using a representation not based on length, you may have to use a non-0 baseline. It may also mean that you might have to plot the data on multiple charts with different scales. The main trade off that you must make is that if a design choice makes the data hard to understand, don't do it. Or if a design choice will make it easier to understand, do it.</p>
